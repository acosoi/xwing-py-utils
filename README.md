# xwing-py-utils
A collection of useful Python scripts for X-Wing: The Miniatures Game by Fantasy Flight Games

These scripts perform various tasks related to the X-Wing miniatures game. You can probably get all of the functionality offered here (and much more) in one of the Squad Builder apps available online. On the other hand, if you're looking to automate work related to X-Wing, I hope you'll find some of these to be useful.

The scripts are dependent on [xwing-data](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data) by [Guido Kessels](https://github.com/guidokessels) for all of the data and images. For ease of use, a copy of the `data` and `images` folders in that repository can be found in this one (last updated on April 7th, 2018).

## inventory.py

In addition to the `data` and `images` folders, this script takes a list of purchases as input:

```
[
    {
        "id": 32,
        "vendor": "RedGoblin.ro",
        "price": 202.35,
        "currency": "RON",
        "date": "2017-12-12"
    }
]
```

The result is a Markdown representation of the inventory generated by those purchases. Example usage (see `bin/generate_inventory.sh`):

```
python ../src/inventory.py --data ../data --images ../images --purchases purchases.js --output generate_inventory_output.md
```

## Future Improvements

* update `MarkdownPrinter` to be able to scale down images (they're currently a bit too large when converting the Markdown output to PDF);
* add a list of moves per ship (preferably with images);
* `xwing-data` does not provide images of actual ships; look for other sources for those images (for use in `inventory.py`).
