# xwing-py-utils
A collection of useful Python scripts for X-Wing: The Miniatures Game by Fantasy Flight Games

There's no single purpose to these scripts, they simply function as sort of command-line squad builder and inventory management system.

The scripts are dependent on [xwing-data](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data) by [Guido Kessels](https://github.com/guidokessels) for all of the data and images.
